# SmartCash

SmartCash – Documentation
Project Description: 
SmartCash is a financial management tool that allows its users to analyze their funds by allocating their assets to different categories.
SmartCash Technical Details:
The front end was built using Java FX and a little bit of CSS. The back end was made using SQL database connections. We have multiple controller files calling methods created in other files enabling great OOP development. The SmartCahs.java folder calls the entirety of the project to be ran, like an executable file. A multitude of libraries were used to implement specific features like 2FA and our database.
